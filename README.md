# Autonomous Driving in Intersections and Roundabouts.
## I'm still working on documenting this repository and the README.
This is the code developed in my end of studies project. It consists in a ROS package that needs information about:

- Odometry
- Polinomial estimations of the lanes of the road

Given this parameters, a node calculates the environment the car is in, for example:

1. Straight road
2. Curved road
3. Crossing 
4. Roundabout 

Other node generates the action to move through the different situations.
